/*
    TypeScript is just a wrapper or Dev Tool (Not a full-fleged language).
    Helps us to remove most of the errors from our codebase during the programming phase.

    It can't be directly compiled.
    It is converted directly into a .js file after compilation that holds the generated TypeSafe JS code 
    that is equivalent to our .ts codes.
